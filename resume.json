      "summary": "My role as an Electronics Technician in Schlumberger consists of maintenance and upgrade of electrical data acquisition equipment, control systems, PLC's, control instrumentation and subsystems of some land based, but primarily offshore cementing/fracturing equipment. I have also worked on coil tubing equipment. As part of my ET role I have attended two maintenance training courses in the US. In both courses I was placed in the top two. These courses provided me with knowledge of mechanical, pneumatic, hydraulic and electronic systems although my background is primarily electronic systems. I also attended a Electronic Engine School in Houston. In my time with Schlumberger I have been able to use my learning and develop good practical hands on skills with all types of equipment, whilst having an understanding of how equipment is used in an engineering environment. Primarily my job as a ET is based in the workshop although I regularly undertake unit maintenance and troubleshooting in offshore locations. Working in this type of environment has taught me to work effectively, under tight deadlines whilst delivering high quality work and abiding by QHSE standards.   ",
